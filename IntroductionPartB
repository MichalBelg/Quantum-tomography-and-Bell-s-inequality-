Firstly, run the code "PartBSimulation.py". 
With the extracted data from the previous code, run the code "Final3DPlotter.m" in order to get the density of the different bit lists lengths. 
The final3DPlotter code is used to represent the density matrix values as a 3D image. use the density matrix values
calculated from the previous part and place them in a csv file, as shown in the Guide.png picture.
The file should be named: "Simulation_angle_bar_data_base_HHVV_bit_num_10"
with the bit num (here it is 10) changed if needed and the base "HHVV" changed if needed.
